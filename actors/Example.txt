TIPS AND GUIDELINES:

- If the Actor has 

- The sequences.npc subsection of sequences should only be used for Actors based on NPC spritesheets;  sequences defined there override the corresponding keys in sequences.left and sequences.right subsections and 
  increase the frame numbers in the sequences by (gfx.npcLeftStart-1) and (gfx.npcRightStart-1) respectively.  So, for example, if sequences.npc.walk is "1,3,5", gfx.npcLeftStart is 5, and gfx.npcRightStart is 12,
  this would be equivalent to defining sequences.left.walk as "5, 7, 9" and sequences.right.walk as "12, 14, 16"

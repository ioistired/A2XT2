DIALOG

IRIS:  Why am I dressed like this?  I'm supposed to be a ghost.
YUYUKO:  I'm the ghost in this level.  If you were a ghost too, that would be confusing.
IRIS:  If you're a ghost, why aren't you wearing a bedsheet?
YUYUKO:  All right, then.  We'll have one final duel to determine who is truly the ghost of this stage!


post-victory
IRIS:  But I won the duel!  Why are you still the ghost?
YUYUKO:  That's how duels work.  Isn't it obvious that the loser would end up as the ghost?
IRIS:  ...




DEMO

DEMO:  Iris, is that you?  What's wrong with your ghost outfit?
YUYUKO:  Iris?  Is she that girl I was fighting earlier?
DEMO:  Oh, she came through here?
YUYUKO:  She was upset that I took over as the ghost of the stage, so we fought over who got to continue the role.
DEMO:  Iris...lost?  I'll avenge her here!


post-victory:
DEMO:  Wait...Iris won?  What were we fighting for, then?

IRIS:  Hey Demo.  The food here is pretty great!
